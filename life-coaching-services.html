<p>If you would like to get the most out of yourself, make your dreams come true, and be truly happy, fulfilled and balanced in all areas of your life like never before, then this will be the most exciting message you will ever read.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s why: my name is Corey Wayne and I am a Life &amp; Peak Performance Coach, a published Author, Public Speaker, and a Successful Entrepreneur.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I came from very humble beginnings. When I finished high school I was trying to decide what I wanted to do with my life. I had always been interested in buying, fixing, and reselling single family homes for a profit. I fell in love with the TV show “This Old House.” I decided to major in Construction Management to learn how to build before starting my own business someday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, after 5 years of college I still had 2 years of course work left to complete in order to get my degree. One class I had to pass in order to graduate was Calculus. I had dropped this class three times in order to keep from getting a failing grade. I had done the same with several other difficult classes. It was starting to look hopeless. I was full of fear that I would never graduate and get my degree.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My whole future was in doubt. I was terrified that if I did not get a degree I could not get a job in construction management, would not be able to have my own business someday, and would be poor, broke, and lonely the rest of my life.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just when it looked like my life was over and I would have to spend my life struggling and working jobs I hated, I met a Life &amp; Peak Performance coach that completely changed my life forever.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He was able to see things I was doing to sabotage myself. He also taught me strategies I could use to radically change the way I looked at things and to get me through the difficult and challenging times. He had been where I was once in his own life and now was a multi-millionaire, a leader, an entrepreneur, happily married, and had all of the material things that everyone dreams about, but few actually have. He taught me the secrets of success that only the worlds top athletes, entrepreneurs, investors, doctors, and experts knew about achieving success and living the life of your dreams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two years after he started coaching me, I graduated college with the degree I wanted (I got an A in Calculus!). I got my dream job working for Centex Rooney, one of the worlds largest commercial General Contractor’s as a project Engineer on the $150 million dollar Coronado Springs Resort at Walt Disney World. I was also formulating my plan to start my own company buying, fixing, and reselling single family homes for a profit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After working for other people for five years learning how to build, I decided I was ready to make my move. I quit my job at Centex Rooney, borrowed $50,000 on my credit cards, and purchased two foreclosure homes in Orlando, FL.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Within two years I had taken on two business partners and we were all making multiple six figure incomes. I was only making $37,000 per year when I left Centex Rooney! We bought and sold 10-12 properties per month. Some we kept and did ourselves and others we flipped to other investors. I bought my first exotic sports car, a red Lotus Espirit V-8 twin turbo 350 hp work of art. I was living in a beautiful foreclosure I purchased for $118,000 that was worth $455,000 after renovations were complete. I bought my first Rolex and was traveling the world staying in five star resorts and living the high life.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I only did about 10-12 hours of real work per week. I was making more money than I could spend, but was bored out of my mind. I just was not fulfilled. By 29 I had a successful business, big house, fancy cars, nice clothes, tons of money, and I was bored. I thought… is this all there is? I had an urge to give back and decided to start a new division of our company doing general real estate and mortgages. My goal was not just to make more money, but to teach people with a burning desire to succeed how to make multiple six figure incomes selling real estate and originating mortgages. One of my partners started a title company to handle the closings. So we took our little company of 4 people in 1999 and built it into 8 companies with 40 employees grossing $6 million dollars per year by 2004. We also purchased a distressed $2.5 million dollar office building for our operations which we later sold for a nice profit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By the end of 2005 I wanted to teach and coach full time. I left our company and used the money I had made from it to start my present company “The Corey Wayne Companies.” In February 2006 I got my first book published “How To Be A 3% Man” which is a dating and relationship book for men. I spend the majority of my time coaching people from all over the world how to have phenomenal success, joy, and balance in all areas of their lives; their finances, relationships, health, businesses, etc.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Having lots of money and material things is nice and I am grateful for all I have, but for me, teaching, coaching, and helping others be their best selves and achieve their dreams fulfills me like nothing else I have ever done.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Due to the success I have achieved and enjoyed it has enabled me to learn personally from the world’s top trainers and coaches. People like Tony Robbins (the world’s most successful and highest paid coach) and Keith Cunningham (the “Rich Dad” from Robert Kiyosaki’s NY Times Best Selling book “Rich Dad Poor Dad.”)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Unlike most of the other Life &amp; Peak Performance Coaches you will find on the internet, I’ve actually done and experienced the things I teach others how to do. As a wise coach once taught me, before you can teach, you must know.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No matter where you are in your life right now, or what challenges you may have, I promise you, I have been there, done that, and got the t-shirt. The reason I can coach you to get the very best out of yourself is because I have learned over my 40 years on this planet how to get the best out of myself first. I’ve learned from the best teachers, and coaches in the world.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Behind every great athlete, entrepreneur, executive, etc. is a great coach. Life is all about our relationships to everyone and everything in this world, hence the name of my website: UnderstandingRelationships.com. At this point in my life I only work about 20 hours a week and get to pick and choose the clients that I coach. Most of my time is spent playing with my friends and family and enjoying life. That’s what a truly balanced life looks like. Life is meant to be lived and enjoyed.</p>
